# Communication Via Morse Vode (CVMC)

<b>Communicate Via Morse Code</b> (CVMC) is a project that helps people who can't see well, those who want to talk but can't, and those who feel uncomfortable in office settings. It helps them communicate with others and feel better by using Morse code. People with vision problems only need to learn Morse code and English. They can still talk to people who speak other languages. We also turned Morse code into a game to help people feel better in offices.
